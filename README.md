# ```Image Tamper Detection```

  Image manipulation is becoming a serious concern in many fields nowadays as the available software to manipulate images is increasing, at the same time it is becoming increasingly hard to authenticate between original and duplicate images. To address this problem, we discuss a few of the famous transfer learning architectures in image classification and how it is used to authenticate between original and manipulated images in the JPEG format, with the use of lossy double compression for preprocessing. The classification is further improved by the new Deep learning architecture, a similar combination of AlexNet and InceptionNet.
